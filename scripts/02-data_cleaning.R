#### Clean data ####

### Fixing up the league_data dataset and renaming columns ###
league_data[12,1] = "2011-12"
league_data <- league_data |> rename(
  "Goals_Per_Game" = "G",
  "PowerPlay_Game" = "PPO",
  "PowerPlay_Pct" = "PP%",
  "Shots_Against" = "SA",
  "Save_Pct" = "SV%",
  "Goals_Against_Avg" = "GAA"
)

### We're only concerned with season and p/gp from forwards and defensemen, so let's select those ###
master_forwards <- master_forwards |> select("Season", "P/GP")
master_dmen <- master_dmen |> select("Season", "P/GP")

## Rename P/GP to something cleaner ##
master_forwards <- master_forwards |> rename("Points_Per_Game" = "P/GP")
master_dmen <- master_dmen |> rename("Points_Per_Game" = "P/GP")

### For shooting, we want season and s% (shooting percentage) ###
master_shooting <- master_shooting |> select("Season", "S%")

### For shooting, we want means per season ###
master_shooting <- master_shooting |> group_by(Season) |> summarise(mean = mean(`S%`))
## Round the values so they're nicer ##
master_shooting <- master_shooting |> round(2)
## Rename the mean column ##
master_shooting <- master_shooting |> rename("Mean_Sh_Pct" = "mean")

### We want to merge shooting data with league data, so let's standardize the Season column ###
master_shooting <- master_shooting |> mutate(
  Season = recode(
    Season,
    "20112012" = "2011-12",
    "20122013" = "2012-13",
    "20132014" = "2013-14",
    "20142015" = "2014-15",
    "20152016" = "2015-16",
    "20162017" = "2016-17",
    "20172018" = "2017-18",
    "20182019" = "2018-19",
    "20192020" = "2019-20",
    "20202021" = "2020-21",
    "20212022" = "2021-22",
    "20222023" = "2022-23"
  )
)

league_data <- merge(league_data, master_shooting, by = "Season")

#### Save data ####
